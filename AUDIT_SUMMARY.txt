QUESTIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS
================================================================================

1. Content Priority: Should we focus on depth (expand existing) or breadth 
   (new guides)?
   → Recommendation: Do both. Expand 3 shortest, add 3 most-demanded new ones.

2. Resource Allocation: Full-time dedicated writer or part-time/outsourced?
   → Recommendation: 1 experienced writer @ 20-25 hrs/week for 3 months

3. Topics: Are there critical gaps we should prioritize beyond screening, 
   renewals, and maintenance?
   → Recommendation: Tax/accounting guide would be high-value if you can 
      partner with CPA for legal review

4. Timeline: Is 6-month roadmap realistic given current resources?
   → Recommendation: Yes, if we focus on impactful expansion vs incremental 
      additions
