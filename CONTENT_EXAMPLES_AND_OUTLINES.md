- What you can and cannot screen for (Fair Housing Act)
- Legal vs illegal screening criteria

[Table]
| Criteria | Legal | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Income (3x rent) | Yes | Objective, consistent |
| Credit score (620+) | Yes | Business necessity |
| Eviction history | Yes | Last 7 years |
| Criminal history | Conditional | Must be related to tenancy |
| Employment verification | Yes | Income validation |
| Rental references | Yes | Landlord history |

**Section 3: Step-by-Step Screening Process (400 words)**

**Step 1: Application Collection (50 words)**
- Get written application before viewing property
- Require consent for background/credit check
- Collect basic info: employment, income, references, eviction history

[Downloadable Application Checklist Template]
- Full name, SSN
- Current/prior addresses (2 years)
- Employment verification (2 months pay stubs)
- Income documentation
- References (3: prior landlords, employer, personal)
- Authorization for background/credit check

**Step 2: Income Verification (75 words)**
- 3x rent rule (standard industry)
  - $2,000 rent = $6,000+ monthly income needed
  - Check: pay stubs, W2s, bank statements, tax returns
  - Self-employed: 2 years tax returns + bank statements
  - Retired: bank statements, pension letters
  - Student loans: promissory notes, disbursement statements

**Step 3: Credit Report Review (100 words)**
- Pull credit report (with tenant consent)
- Benchmarks:
  - 650+: Good
  - 600-650: Fair (may require co-signer)
  - <600: High risk (consider additional verification)
- Red flags: Recent late payments, high debt, delinquent accounts
- Recent credit issues can be offset by co-signer or higher deposit
- Sample response: "Your credit score is [X]. We can move forward with [your co-signer co-signing] or additional deposit of $[X]."

**Step 4: Eviction & Criminal History (100 words)**
- Review eviction history (last 7 years)
- Any evictions? Ask for explanation.
- Criminal history related to rental tenancy
- (Note: Use carefully; consult legal counsel on compliance)
- Benchmarks:
  - No evictions + clean criminal history: Approval
  - Single old eviction with explanation: May approve
  - Multiple evictions: Reject
  - Recent violent crime: Reject
  - Older misdemeanor unrelated to tenancy: May approve

**Step 5: Reference Checks (75 words)**
- Contact at least 2 prior landlords
- Questions to ask:
  1. "How long did [tenant] live there?"
  2. "Did they pay rent on time?"
  3. "Were there any property damage issues?"
  4. "Would you rent to them again?"
  5. "Any behavioral or noise complaints?"
- Verify employment with employer HR
- Red flags: evasive answers, short tenancy, late payment stories

**Section 4: Common Screening Mistakes (200 words)**

**Mistake 1: Inconsistent Criteria**
- Problem: Accepting 580 credit score for one tenant, rejecting 600 for another
- Fix: Document your criteria in writing. Apply same standards to all.
- Why it matters: Violates Fair Housing Act; opens you to complaints

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Red Flags**
- Problem: Prior eviction with "okay explanation"
- Fix: Trust your instincts. If you have doubt, ask more questions or decline.
- Stat: Tenants with prior evictions have 3x higher re-eviction rates

**Mistake 3: Over-Relying on One Factor**
- Problem: Rejecting based only on credit score, ignoring income/employment
- Fix: Holistic review. Strong income can offset lower credit score.

**Mistake 4: Asking Illegal Questions**
- Problem: Asking about family plans, religion, marital status
- Fix: Stick to objective financial criteria (income, credit, references)

**Mistake 5: Slow Decision-Making**
- Problem: Taking 2 weeks to decide; tenant loses patience
- Fix: Decide within 24-48 hours; approved or denied

**Section 5: Fair Housing Compliance (150 words)**

Content:
- Fair Housing Act protections (protected classes)
- Document everything (decisions, reasons, timeline)
- Treat all applicants consistently
- Never: inquire about, consider, or discriminate based on:
  - Race or color
  - Religion
  - National origin
  - Familial status (children)
  - Disability
  - Gender/sexual orientation
- Consequences: Federal penalties $10,000-$50,000+

**Recommendation:** Have legal review your screening criteria annually.

**Section 6: Tenant Screening Tools & Services (150 words)**

Options:
- Online screening services (AppFolio, Zillow, RentBureau)
- Third-party background check companies
- Credit bureaus directly
- DIY verification (call references, verify income)

Cost-benefit:
- DIY: Free but time-consuming, inconsistent
- Third-party: $25-$50/applicant, consistent, legal protection
- Recommendation: Use third-party service for legal compliance

**Section 7: FAQ (250 words)**

**Q: "Can I reject a tenant for bad credit?"**
A: Yes, if you apply the criteria consistently to all applicants. Document your credit score threshold (e.g., "minimum 650") and apply it equally.

**Q: "What if a tenant has recent late payments but high income?"**
A: Evaluate holistically. High income + recent late payments = paying inconsistently despite ability. You can approve, require higher deposit, or require co-signer.

**Q: "How far back should I check eviction history?"**
A: Industry standard is 7 years. Older evictions can be overlooked if tenant has clean record since.

**Q: "Can I require a co-signer?"**
A: Yes, if you require it consistently for all applicants in similar situations. Cannot target specific groups (e.g., "only for younger applicants").

**Q: "What's a reasonable response time for tenant decision?"**
A: 24-48 hours. Delays lose good tenants to other landlords.

**Q: "Should I interview tenants in person?"**
A: Recommended. Personality fit matters. But don't make decisions based on gut feeling—rely on documented criteria.

**Q: "What if a reference won't call back?"**
A: Try multiple times. If unavailable, move forward with other references. Document your attempts.

**Q: "Can I reject based on occupation?"**
A: Only if income is insufficient. Cannot reject because of specific industry (e.g., "no gig workers").

---

**Section 3: Rent Increase Decision Framework (300 words)**

**Step 1: Research Market Rent**
- Run rent comps for your property
- Use Rent Estimate Calculator
- Compare to: last lease rent, current market, property improvements

[Example Math]
- Current rent: $2,000
- Market comp: $2,200 (current market rate)
- Option A: Increase to $2,150 (7.5%)
  - Retain good tenant, slightly below market
  - Pro: Avoid turnover cost
  - Con: Leaving money on table

- Option B: Increase to $2,200 (10%)
  - Market rate
  - Pro: Maximize revenue
  - Con: Tenant may decline

- Option C: Increase to $2,050 (2.5%)
  - Minimal increase
  - Pro: Easy acceptance
  - Con: Below market, opportunity cost

**Step 2: Evaluate Tenant Performance**
- Payment history: Always on time = retention priority
- Condition: Maintained well = less turnover risk
- Tenure: 2+ years = established, reliable tenant
- Behavioral: No complaints = stability

[Tenant Score Table]
| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Perfect payment history (24+ months) | +3 |
| Good payment history (1-2 late in 24 mo) | +1 |
| Late payments or defaults | -2 |
| Property well-maintained | +2 |
| Property damage/excessive wear | -2 |
| 2+ years tenancy | +2 |
| <1 year tenancy | 0 |
| No complaints | +2 |
| Complaints on file | -2 |

Score 10-12: Offer competitive rate (keep them)
Score 7-9: Offer market rate (they're good)
Score <7: Consider non-renewal (or higher rent)

**Step 3: Calculate Your Retention Value**
- True cost of replacing tenant: $3,000-$5,000
- Breakeven increase: If you can offer 5% increase instead of 10%, worth it to avoid turnover
- Example: $2,000 rent
  - Market rent: $2,200
  - Turnover cost: $4,000
  - Offer: $2,100 (5% increase)
  - Tenant accepts: You save $4,000-$100 = net +$3,900
